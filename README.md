### :zap: Simple performance
ÂµWebSockets.js is a standards compliant web server written in 10,000 lines of C++. It is exposed to Node.js as a native V8 addon and performs 10x that of Socket.IO, 8.5x that of Fastify. It makes up the core components of Bun and is the fastest standards compliant web server in the TechEmpower (not endorsed) benchmarks.

We aren't in the NPM registry but you can install it with the NPM client: `npm install uNetworking/uWebSockets.js#v20.44.0`

### :dash: In essence
